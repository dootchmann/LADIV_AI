BELIEVER

First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh

Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail
I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard
Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh


But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…


Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer

THUNDER

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir," not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic," they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder


Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)

Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
(Woah-oh-ohh)
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
(Woah-oh-ohh)
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

SUCKER FOR PAIN

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

Dolla Sign! I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty; that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

I been at it with my homies, it don't matter, you don't know me
I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my, squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up 'cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been bussin', no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain

More pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin'...

DEMONS

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

WHATEVER IT TAKES

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

RADIOACTIVE

Whoah-oh

Whoah

I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
Yeah, ah

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa-oh, whoa

All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will Heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong

Leave behind your heart and cast away

Will somebody
Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing?
What's happenin'?
Lookin' through the glass, find the wrong within the past knowin'
Oh, we are the youth
Cut until it bleeds inside a world without the peace, facing
A bit of the truth, the truth

Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey

Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it

NEXT TO ME

Something about the way that you walked into my living room
Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am
But still you, still you want me
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics, and deficits
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'
But still you, still you want me

Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me (next to me)

There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless

I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
And still you, still you want me

Oh, I always let you down

But still, I find you there

IT'S TIME

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit

WALKING THE WIRE

Do you feel the same when I'm away from you? (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you? (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
We could turn around or we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes

Oh, the storm is ragin' against us now (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
But we took the step, oh, we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

There's nights we had to just walk away (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
It's a price you pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walkin' the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below

Oh, I'll take your hand when thunder roars
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course
I promise you from up above
That we'll take what comes, take what comes, love

We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up (Couldn't be, couldn't be)
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walkin' the wire, wire, wire

ZERO

I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I’m empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

I find it hard to tell you how I wanna run away
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, send me ’nother demigod
I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do, no
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there’s nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
Maybe you're the same as me
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
They say the truth will set you free

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real

ENEMY

(Look out for yourself)

I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us (Ha)

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look; yeah)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look, okay

I'm hopin' that somebody pray for me
I'm prayin' that somebody hope for me
I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy

Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint
(Look out for yourself)

WARRIORS

As a child, you would wait and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream

Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust

The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Above the rest and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be
The labor of my love

Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust

Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)

RISE UP

I was hopin' for an indication
I was seekin' higher elevation
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I've been shaken, wakin' in the night light
I've been breakin', hidin' from the spotlight
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)

Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I was there, but I was always leaving
I've been livin', but I was never breathing
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)

I'm burstin' like the Fourth of July
So color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life
So embrace it and leave me to stray

I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (rise, rise up)
I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)

(Rise, rise up)
(Rise, rise up)

I DON'T KNOW WHY

We could be strangers in the night
We could be passing in the shadows
We couldn't be closer if we tried
When we're caught in the headlights
We could be faces in the crowd
We could be passin' in the shadows
Lovin' the risk of bein' found
When we're caught in the headlights

Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust

I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you

I was a vacant alibi
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh
We were the essence of desire
And we're caught in the headlights

Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust

I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know, ah)
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you

Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Dangerous
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Your love is always dangerous
Tell me that you love me

I don't know why

I don't know why (Ah)

ON TOP OF THE WORLD

If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

Now take it in but don't look down...

'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I could've gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

Now take it in, but don't look down...

'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt

Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but
Get up, now, get up, get up, now
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but
Get up, now, get up, get up, now

'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
(And I know it's hard when you're falling down)
I'm on top of the world, hey
(And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but)
Waiting on this for a while now
(Get up, now, get up)
Paying my dues to the dirt

I've been waiting to smile, hey

Been holding it in for a while, hey

Take you with me if I can

BORN TO BE YOURS

I know I've given up
A hundred times before
But I know a miracle
Is not something to ignore

You take me for a fool

Are you the only one
Lost in the millions?
Or are you my grain of sand
That's blowing in the wind?

I never knew anybody ‘til I knew you

And I know when it rains, oh, it pours

About time for anyone telling you
Off for all your deeds

Somehow, somehow?

Please forgive me for all I've done

MONSTER

Ever since I could remember
Everything inside of me
Just wanted to fit in (Oh, oh, oh)
I was never one for pretenders
Everything I tried to be
Just wouldn't settle in (Oh, oh, oh)

If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seemed dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
That this problem lies in me

I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger

Can I clear my conscience
If I'm different from the rest?
Do I have to run and hide? (Oh, oh, oh)
I never said that I want this
This burden came to me
And it's made its home inside (Oh, oh, oh)

If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seemed dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
That this problem lies in me

I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger

I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger

AMSTERDAM

I'm sorry, mother, I'm sorry, I let you down
Well, these days I'm fine; no, these days I tend to lie
I'll take the Western train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by my left brain, just by the side of the Tin Man

I'm sorry, brother, I'm sorry, I let you down
Well, these days you're fine; no, these days you tend to lie
You'll take the Western train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by your left brain, just by the side of the Tin Man

Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me, I've tried
But I keep coming up short

I'm sorry, lover, I'm sorry I bring you down
Well, these days I try, and these days I tend to lie
Kinda thought it was a mystery, and then I thought it wasn't meant to be
You said yourself fantastically, "Congratulations, you are all alone!"

Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me, I've tried
Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me, I've tried
[Bridge]
But the rain won't fall for the both of us
The sun won't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say
That I wouldn't have it any other way

Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me, I've tried

But I won't wait much longer
'Cause these walls, they're crashing down
No, I won't wait much longer
'Cause these walls, they're crashing down
And I keep coming up short

DREAM

In the dark, and I'm right on the middle mark
I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen
And I'm short of the others' dreams of being golden and on top
It's not what you painted in my head
There's so much there instead of all the colors that I saw

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

In the eyes of a teenage crystallized
Oh, the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
And the cries from the strangers out at night
They don't keep us up at night
We have the curtains drawn and closed

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

I know all your reasons
To keep me from seeing
Everything is actually a mess
But now I am leaving
All of us were only dreaming
Everything is actually a mess

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream
But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

POLAROID

I'm a reckless mistake
I'm a cold night's intake
I'm a one night too long
I'm a come on too strong

All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rollin' freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

I'm a hold my cards close
I'm a wreck what I love most
I'm a first class letdown
I'm a "shut up, sit down"

I am a head case
I am the color of boom
That's never arriving
And you are the pay raise
Always a touch out of view
And I am the color of boom

All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover


Whoa, how did it come to this?
Oh, love is a polaroid, oh
Better in picture
(But) never can fill the void

I'm a midnight talker
Oh, I'm an alley walker
I'm a day late two-face
I'm a burn out quick pace

I am a head case
I am the color of boom
That's never arriving
And you are the opera
Always on time and in tune
And I am the color of boom

All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

Whoa, how did it come to this?
Oh, love is a polaroid, oh
Better in picture
(But) never can fill the void

I'm gonna get ready
For the rain to pour heavy
Let it fall, fall
Let it fall upon my head

All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

Whoa, how did it come to this?
Oh, love is a polaroid, oh
Better in picture
(But) never can fill the void

Oh, love is a polaroid
Oh, love is a polaroid

BLEEDING OUT

I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
I’m bleeding out
I’m bleeding out for you, for you

When the day has come
That I’ve lost my way around
And the seasons stop
And hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns grey
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating

Oh, you tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
And I’m bleeding out
I’m bleeding out for you, for you

When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To fill the night with hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow

You tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
And I’m bleeding out
I’m bleeding out for you, for you

I’m bleeding out for you, for you
I’m bleeding out for you, for you
I’m bleeding out for you, for you
I’m bleeding out for you

'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
And I’m bleeding out
I’m bleeding out for you, for you

GOLD

First comes a blessing of all that you've dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings
Only at first did it have its appeal
But now you can't tell the false from the real

Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?

When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold

Gold
Gold
Gold
Gold

Statues and empires are all at your hands
Water to wine and the finest of sands
When all that you have's turning stale and it's cold
Oh, you'll no longer feel when your heart's turned to gold

Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?

When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold

Gold
Gold
Gold
Gold

I'm dying to feel again
Oh, anything at all
But, oh, I feel nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing

When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold

WEST COAST

One more day we'll spend together
Let your eyes look up upon me for the better
Oh, I know I'm worse for weather
But, my love, I won't give up
Spend my days cursing my soul
Wishing I could paint my scars and make me whole
Oh, I know I could be better
But, my love, I won't give up

I ain't no Superman, I ain't no Holy Ghost
I'm just the one that keeps you up at night, you love the most

And all your tears that you have cried will go away
Oh, just grant me one more day
Oh, my love, please don't give up
See the Devil at my door
I see the future of the ones that I've ignored
I guess I was born to be at war
And, my love, I won't give up
So, my love, please don't give up

I ain't no Superman, I ain't no Holy Ghost
I'm just the one who keeps you up at night, you love the most
I'll be your strong man, I'll be your West Coast

Took your heart, took your hand
Promise you all that I had
Hopin' that you understand
Far from a perfect man

It seem like we're goin' nowhere
Cryin' inside your bedroom

BULLET IN A GUN

The Roman king, the Romulus
The precipice, born to change
The final days, the last embrace
Augustus, Nero, taking names

I'm high, then I'm low, low
Stop, then I go, go
Bipolar, oh, oh
Yes, then I'm no, no
My time will come, I promise that
Pull the trigger back, back

Bullet in a gun (Hey)
But in the end, my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun
Blood, sweat, and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Bullet in a gun (Bu-bu, hey), gun (Hey), gun (Bu-bu, hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Bu-bu, hey), gun (Hey), gun (Bu-bu, hey)
Bullet in a gun

To make a name, you pay the price
You give your life, no other way
The devil's deal, it comes around
To wear the crown, rise up from the ground

I'm high, then I'm low, low
Stop, then I go, go
Bipolar, oh, oh
Yes, then I'm no, no
My time will come, I promise that
Pull the trigger back, back

Bullet in a gun (Hey)
But in the end, my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun
Blood, sweat, and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Bullet in a gun (Bu-bu, hey), gun (Hey), gun (Bu-bu, hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Bu-bu, hey), gun (Hey), gun (Bu-bu, hey)
Bullet in a gun

How many voices go unheard?
How many lessons never learned?
How many artists fear the light?
Fear the pain, go insane?
Lose your mind, lose yourself
(You only care about fame and wealth)
Sellout, sellout, sellout

Bullet in a gun (Hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
But in the end, my time will come
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Like a bullet in a gun
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)
Blood, sweat, and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun (Hey), gun (Hey), gun (Hey)

COOL OUT

Cool out, cool out

Just before I go
Yes, I know that I'm losing control and
I want to take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control
I know I'm always pacing
And I blame it on the pressure I'm facing
I wanna take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control

I'm standing on your front porch saying, "Don't go"
You were lookin' at me wild saying, "Just go home," and

Cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, play nice
And just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out

You're always saying that you read my sign and
Always wishing that I take the time but
You know that's not my speed
Only believe what I can see
I live my life in black-and-white
I know that's not what you would like
That's all I know
I put my mind in cruise control

I'm standing on your front porch saying, "Don't go"
You were lookin' at me wild saying, "Just go home," and

Cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, play nice
And just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out (Cool out)
So cool out (Cool out)

All the things that you detest in me
They keep you coming back for more, you see
We make each other get a bit crazy
But you will always be a part of me

Cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, play nice
And just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out

So cool out (Cool out, cool out)
Cool out (Cool out, cool out)
So cool out (Cool out, cool out)
(Cool out, cool out)

SMOKE AND MIRRORS

This is my word, this is my way
Show me a sign, sweep me away
This is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
Deep in my heart, deep in my mind
Take me away, take me away
This is my word, dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind

All I believe, is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe, whoa
But all that I know
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)

All that I've known, buildings of stone
Fall to the ground without a sound
This is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
I'm starting to cave, I'm losing my flame
I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain
To disappear, dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind

All I believe, is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe, whoa
But all that I know
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)

Believe
I want to believe

All I believe, is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe, whoa
But all that I know
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)

NOTHING LEFT TO SAY / ROCKS

Who knows how long I've been awake now?
The shadows on my wall don't sleep
They keep calling me
Beckoning (Beckoning)
Who knows what's right? The lines keep getting thinner
My age has never made me wise
But I keep pushing
On and on
And on and on

(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now
(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now
(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now

Below my soul, I feel an engine
Collapsing as it sees the pain
If I could only shut it out
(Shut it out, shut it out, shut it out)
I've come too far to see the end now
Even if my way is wrong
And I keep pushing
On and on and on and on

(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now
(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now
(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now

I keep falling, I keep falling down
I keep falling, I keep falling down (Hey)
I keep falling, I keep falling down
I keep falling, I keep falling down
If you could only save me
I'm drowning in the waters of my soul...

(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now (Nothing left to say)
(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now, oh!
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now

Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
I threw some rocks up at your window
I broke some rocks right through your window

Timber, timber, we're falling down
Let the forest hear our sound
Boom, ba-doom ba-doom, ah-ooh ah-ooh
Boom, ba-doom ba-doom, ah-ooh ah-ooh
Why can't I see
What's right in front of me?

We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart

START OVER

Clenched teeth, no words
All this distance taking its toll
Speaking volumes
Silence screaming over your words

I never did you right, I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I wanna try again

Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?

Cold nights, cold sheets
One more lonely empty hotel room
What I'd give to
Find my way back into you

I never did you right, and I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I wanna try again

Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?
Can we start over?
Can we get closer?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?

Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again

Can we start, can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?
Can we start over?
(Come alive, come alive, come alive again)
Can we get closer?
(Come alive, come alive, come alive again)
Can we start over
(Come alive, come alive, come alive again)
Before it's over, over?

BURN OUT

Patience only gets you so far
Blood will get you further
Pain will only make your heart hard
Tossed in fury's weather
Innocence is beautiful to see
Won't you box it up for me? (For me)
For me

Oh, give me strength, and give me peace
Does anyone out there want to hear me?

It's just another downpour, don't let it get the best of you
It's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me

Sadness is my enemy
I fear time will age him gently
Walking by my side for all these years
Seems that we've grown friendly
Happiness is beautiful to see
Won't you box it up for me? (For me)
For me

Oh, give me strength, and give me peace
Does anyone out there want to hear me?

It's just another downpour, don't let it get the best of you
It's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me

It's just another downpour
It's just another downpour
I won't give up
I won't give up
I won't give up
I won't

It's just another downpour, don't let it get the best of you
It's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you
I don't wanna let you go, I don't wanna let you go
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
I don't wanna let you go, I don't wanna let you go
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me

LOVE

It's been a long time comin’, comin'
Seeming like we all been runnin', runnin’
Feeling like the wild west, gunnin', gunnin'
Listen to our elders shunnin', shunnin'
Flipping on the news beat talkin', talkin'
All about the problems, shockin', shockin’
We put on our headphones walking, walking
We put on our headphones

Where did we all go wrong?
Love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?

All we see is faces, color, color
All the other races, other, other
Why can’t you just be my brother, brother?
We don't have to kill one another, kill one another
All around the world, we are one, we are one
All around the world, we are one

So where did we all go wrong?
Love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?

Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love

Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?

'Cause we got the same blood, blood
We got the same blood, blood
Will it be enough, 'nough?
Will it be enough?
We got the same heartbeat
We're living for the same dream
We got the same bloodstream
Where did we all go wrong?

Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?
Love, love, love, love
(It’s darkest before the dawn)
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
(Love is our only hope)
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love, oh
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love

Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?
Where did we all, where did we all?
Where did we all, where did we all? (Oh)

BATTLE CRY

Just one more time
Before I go, I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now

Stars are only visible in darkness
Fear is ever-changing and evolving
And I, I feel poisoned inside
But I, I feel so alive

Nobody can save me now
King is crowned
It's do or die
Nobody can save me now
The only sound
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Nobody can save me now
It's do or die

Nobody can save me now
King is crowned
It's do or die
Nobody can save me now
The only sound
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Nobody can save me now
It's do or die

Just one more time
Before I go, I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now

WRECKED

Days pass by, and my eyes, they dry, and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation, fading away
The way you smile, the way you walk
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day

Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
Yeah, I'm a wreck

They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away
But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh when your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day

Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
]
These days when I'm on the brink of the edge
I remember the words that you said
"Remember the life you led"
You'd say, "Oh, suck it all up, don't get stuck in the mud
Thinking of things that you should have done"
I'll see you again, my loved one
I'll see you again, my loved one
Yeah, I'm a wreck
I'll see you again, my loved one

Yeah, I'm a wreck without you here
(I'm a wreck without you here, loved one)
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
(I'm a wreck since you've been gone)
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along (I'm a wreck)
Yeah, I'm a wreck

Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away (But I can't)
One more rainy day without you (One more rainy day)
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day (But I can't)
One more rainy day

CUTTHROAT

I've been waiting patiently
I built this tower quietly
And when my well of Wellbutrin is
Running dry of serotonin
I can say things I don't mean
Or maybe it's the truth in me
I feel it building, bubbling up
My t-t-time is up

I'm so (Mis-) misunderstood (-un)
But I live for this (-der), my money's good (-stood)
And I came to win (Mis-), so step on up (-un)
And I promise you

Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat)
Only one of us
Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you (Cutthroat)
Only one of us
Only one of us gon' make it out alive

I've been making my Gethsemane
Since I was young, my ancestry (Cutthroat)
Was marching martyrdom across the
Radadada dumbla plains of Utah (Cutthroat)
I can't lie, I've been played
By powerful pеople who get their way
But I, in timе, will climb my mountain

I'm so (Mis-) misunderstood (-un)
But I live for this (-der), my money's good (-stood)

TIPTOE

In the morning light, let my roots take flight
Watch me fall above like a vicious dove
They don't see me come, who can blame them?
They never seem to catch my eye
But I've never wondered why

I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep...

Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher

From your slanted view, see the morning dew
Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
They won't see me run, who can blame them?
They never look to see me fly
So I've never had to lie

I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep...

Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher

Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else...

Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming

Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low

Cherry bomb, headstrong

Looking just to make broke

It's not a picture perfect life

HEAR ME

Try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try

Try to hear my voice
You can leave, now it's your choice
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
Maybe if I leave tonight, I won't come back

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too?

You kiss and you kiss, and you love and you love
You've got a history list, and the rest is above
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me
From the floor to the floor, and the sky to the sky
You've got to love and adore and the rest is awry
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too?

Leave your shoes at the door, baby
I am all you adore, lately
Come with me and we will run away!

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too?
Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too?

REAL LIFE

She says that the world is a broken mess
And it's always on her mind
She cries at the news when the shots ring out
Oh, every single time

And no, I cannot fix it, no, I cannot make it stop

So I said, "Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?"
Oh, "Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?"

She prays on her knees as the towers fall
To a god she does not know
She's begging him to stop the mess
As the Boston bombs will blow (Ooh)
She says, "How could I ever believe in something
That would step aside and watch?"
And I got no words to say 'cause I think I lost my faith
But I fake it for the day, oh, everything will be okay

But no, I cannot fix it, and I cannot make it stop
[Chorus]
So I said, "Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?"
Oh, "Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?"

I wish I had the answers
Something you could hold to
Only thing that's real to me is you

"Turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?"
Oh, "Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?"

Oh, hey (Real life, hey)
Real life, real life
Oh, hey
Real life, real life

STUCK

Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Yeah, time goes by and still I am stuck on you, ooh, you, ooh

I've been afraid, don't wanna fade out of my body
I've been astray, barely awake, floating above me
Covered in gray, what can I say? I've been a zombie
I'm feeling like I've been locked in a grave
You were the laugh, you were the life, you were the party
You were the brave, I was the weak, you were the army
You were the faith, you were the truth, I was the sorry
I'm feeling like you've been taken away

You were my one, you were my one
When all has been said, all has been done
You were my one, you were my one
Now I am left reaching above me, oh, oh

Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Ooh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)
Yeah, time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Ooh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)

Why did you leave? Why did you go leaving me lonely?
Didn't you know you were the home, you were the only?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Come back to me

You were my one, you were my one
When all has been said, all has been done
You were my one, you were my one
Now I am left reaching above me, oh, oh

Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Ooh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Ooh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Yeah, time goes by and still I am stuck on you, stuck on you
Oh, oh, oh, woah (Woah-oh, woah, oh)

As time goes by, as time goes by, woah
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Ooh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Ooh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)

You know how we do

I want a new world without the order
I wanna resurrect and live a little shorter

MY LIFE

Can I wish on a star for another life?
'Cause it feels like I'm all on my own tonight
And I find myself in pieces
There are pills on the table and a thought in my head
And I walk through the halls where I used to be led
My heart is filled with reasons

I'm trying to be somebody else
I'm finding it hard to love myself
I've wanted to be somebody new
But that is impossible to do

I'm running out of my mind
Is this really my life?
I'm running out of time
Is this really my life? My life

I could run from it all, but I'd only get lost
Oh, I've walked on the bridge that I shouldn't have crossed
And I find myself a user
Oh, I wake every day with addictions to feed
They all call me a friend, but I'll never be freed
From the face of a faithless future

I'm trying to be somebody else
I'm finding it hard to love myself
I've wanted to be somebody new
But that is impossible to do

I'm running out of my mind
Is this really my life?
I'm running out of time
Is this really my life? My life

These years pass by and we're growing older
And I think of you, all we've made it through
Some have passed away, some have moved on
But I'm still here today (I'm here today)

These years pass by and I am growing older
And I think of you and all we've made it through
Some have passed away, there's no words to say
No second tries, is this my life?
And I think of you

I'm running out of my mind
Is this really my life?
I'm running out of time
Is this really my life? My life

WHO WE ARE

Up in the morning
Up in the evening
Picking up clocks
When the birds come back to eat
Oh, to eat
Up on the mountain
Down in the king's lair
Pushing these blocks
In the heat of the afternoon
Oh, afternoon

We were never welcome here
We were never welcome here at all
No

It’s who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
Oh, won’t you save us
What we are?
Don’t look clear
'Cause it’s all uphill from here
Oh

Up in the attic
Down in the cellar
Lost in the static
Coming back for more
Oh, for more
Out with the reason
In with the season
Taking down names
In my book of jealousy
Jealousy

We were never welcome here
We were never welcome here at all
No

It’s who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
Because it's who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
Oh, won't you save us
What we are?
Don’t look clear
'Cause it’s all uphill from here
Oh

They say we’re crazy
They say we're crazy
They say we're crazy

GIANTS

Take a hit of anything
To escape it all, I'm suffocating
A sharpened blade of reality
Sometimes, I wanna hurt me
I know it's hard to hear, but I'm
Waitin' for the new year
Don't wanna waste my life chasin' white
Try to swim towards the light

Comin' up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
I thought I learned it all, but boom, the plot thickens
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Got so tired of feelin' numb
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Well, take a look what I've become
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety

Wanna make you proud of me
But slowly, I am killing me
Playing with chemistry
Floating to thе ceiling
Always rock 'n' roll 'til you die, you know, you been flyin'
Now I'm shaking at night, sweating thе sheets out
Grinding my teeth out
But still the world will glamorize it all

Comin' up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
I thought I learned it all, but boom, the plot thickens
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Got so tired of feelin' numb
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Well, take a look what I've become
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety

If I could leave one thing for you
It's exactly what not to do
I'm so proud of you
Take a look what I've become
Oh, take a look what I've

Comin' up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
I thought I learned it all, but boom, the plot thickens
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Got so tired of feelin' numb
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Well, take a look what I've become
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly

LONELY

Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely
Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely

Some nights I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it

I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, no day in a life
Mixin' it up, checkin' it twice
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life

Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said—

Sometimes, I smile to keep things easy
I hide in corners, hope that no one sees me

So I'm playin' the role, ridin' the bull, stuck in a hole
Takin' a bow, lookin' so proud
Look at me now, talkin' about pills in my mouth
Under the tongue, isn't it fun?
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life, oh-oh

Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)

I said, "Oh, love" (Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
Have mercy (Help keep me company, I said, oh, love)
Oh, love, can you please have mercy on me? (Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
Can you keep me company? (Help keep me company, I said, help)
L-O-N-E-L-Why am I so lonely?

Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
(Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
(Help keep me company, I said, oh, love)
I said, oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
(Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
(Help keep me company, I said, oh, love)
I said, oh—

LEVITATE

There's so much on my mind, I don't know where to start
It's that light in your eye filling up the dark
Though I lost myself, I know it's not the end
You're my shooting star, you make my heart ascend

La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Just levitate, just levitate

I know that we're far from where we need to be
But the world wasn't made in just one day
Though our journey's long, I know our love is strong
You're my shooting star, we're flying high above

La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Just levitate, just levitate

When I'm stuck in the middle of hell and faith
I don't know where to turn
To bend my mind as the silver gate
You lead me on my way
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la

DULL KNIVES

I'm holding my breath, holding so tight
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right
I'm in the dark, looking for light
Won't someone please save my life?
Inside, I'm a mess, but I don't let it show
I'm just hanging on, but you'd never know
I smile all day, and cry through the night
Won't someone please save my
Life is fleeting

Dull knives taking my life
A slow burn fire from the inside
Dull knives twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind

A smoldering flame, deep in my heart
Barely a sign, it's barely a spark
Holding on through every night
Won't someonе please save my lifе?
I'm crying for help, it's such a cliché
Invisible pain, it's filling each day
I open my mouth and feed you a lie
Won't someone please save
My life is fleeting, no repeating

Dull knives taking my life
A slow burn fire from the inside
Dull knives twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind

Dull knives ripping from the inside
Spare me the ride

From the inside
Dull knives twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind
Dull knives

IT'S OK

She could always hear every word they say
Everybody walks like they just know the way
Every single day holding back the tears
She'd never say a word 'cause there's nobody that hears

It's okay to be not okay
It's just fine to be out of your mind
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind, mind

Mine is broken, how is yours?
Sure, it helps to hear the news and political discourse
Fear, that is what he felt
Every single day as all the boys would play
Don't you darе be weak, emasculatеd freak
Last up on the fence, tell me, where's the sense?

It's okay to be not okay
It's just fine to be out of your mind
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind

I don't want this body, I don't want this voice
I don't wanna be here, but I guess I have no choice
Just let me live my truth, that's all I wanna do
Baby, you're not broken, just a little bit confused

It's okay to be not okay (I need you here with me)
It's just fine to be out of your mind (I can't do it all alone)
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind (It's okay, out of your mind)
It's okay to be not okay (I need you here with me)
It's just fine to be out of your mind (I can't do it all alone)
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind (It's okay, come on and on and on and on)

IT COMES BACK TO YOU

4 AM, beside myself
And what I think of mental health
All the things that worry me
All the things you don't believe
I've been told just what to do
Where to look and point my view
All the things that I could be
I think I learned in therapy

Am I just a shadow you drew?

It comes back to you
It comes back to you
All the things that you had lost
Will find their way to you
It comes back to you
It comes back to you
Looking back into the past
And I can see it through

It comes back to you, oh
It comes back to you, oh
It comes back to you, oh
It comes back to you

Mocking birds and diamond rings
Oh, I have thought of greater things
All the things that fly by me
All the lives that I could lead
Maybe I was born for that
Or maybe I was first to last
You could call it cowardice
But leave me to my studied bliss

Am I just a shadow you drew?

It comes back to you
It comes back to you
All the things that you had lost
Will find their way to you
It comes back to you
It comes back to you
Looking back into the past
And I can see it through

It comes back to you, oh
It comes back to you, oh
It comes back to you, oh
It comes back to you

MONDAY

When you're down on your luck
I take them hands and I turn it up
When you're face to the floor
I turn the dial, turn it up more
I'm there for you
Will you be there for me too? Ooh

I believe (I believe) in the cause (In the cause)
I'm pound-for-pound, baby, turn it on

Give me lovin', keep me goin' 'til the midnight hour
Bring me up, lift me up to your rainbow tower
Your rainbow tower

EASY COME EASY GO

All my friends are gone, I don't blame them
I guess I'd move on, do the same thing
So I wrote a song to be my lullaby
Sing me to sleep at night, open my third eye

I'm not gon' lie to you, I miss you so much
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch?
I'm not gon' lie to you, this has been a hard year
How I wish that you were here

I just need to let it go, waitin' on a miracle
Guess that's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go, turn it down and lay low
It's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go

Sometimes I drive a little too fast
Think I'm runnin' from demons of my past
So I wrote a song to help me slow down
Keep my mind straight, but it's a bit late

I'm not gon' lie to you, I miss you so much
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch?
I'm not gon' lie to you, this has been a hard year
How I wish that you were here

I just need to let it go, waitin' on a miracle
Guess that's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go, turn it down and lay low
It's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go), waitin' on a miracle (Waitin' on a miracle)
Guess that's just the way it goes (Guess that's just the way it goes), easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go), turn it down, and lay low (Lay low)
It's just the way it goes (It's just the way it goes), easy come, easy go

Remember when you got sick, cancer of the bone
Everyone in school while you're sittin' at home
In your wheelchair of grief, find no relief
We were there for the ups and downs and there for the constant rounds of chemo
Yeah, you know that you are our hero
You were there when I was a zero
And I swear I'll make things right before the long night
Swear I'll make things right tomorrow
But as for tonight

I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go), waitin' on a miracle (Waitin' on a miracle)
Guess that's just the way it goes (Guess that's just the way it goes), easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go), turn it down, and lay low (Lay low)
It's just the way it goes (It's just the way it goes), easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go), waitin' on a miracle (Waitin' on a miracle)
Guess that's just the way it goes (Guess that's just the way it goes), easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go), turn it down, and lay low (Lay low)
It's just the way it goes (It's just the way it goes), easy come, easy go

I just need to let it go (I just need to let it go), waitin' on a miracle (Waitin' on a miracle)

THE FALL

Maybe I'm broken, maybe I'm wrong
I could've spoken sooner than I should've
Only the good die old
That's what they told me, but I don't know

Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking
I should just keep to the things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

Do you know? Do you know?
You're all I know, you're all I know
When everything comes crashing down
You're all I know, you're all I know

I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything
That I believed in to drift away
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away

Maybe I'm destined to be distraught
Always a reason, breaking me down to my
Knees in the dead of night
I keep on praying to see the light, oh-oh-oh

Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking
I should just keep to the things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

Do you know? Do you know?
You're all I know, you're all I know
When everything comes crashing down
You're all I know, you're all I know

Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away

You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me

TROUBLE

Oh, quiet down, I've had enough
I guess it's now or never
I've been around, I've settled up
I'll bolt soon or later

I took a photograph of me
When I was only nineteen
I looked a little lost at sea
I keep trying to find me

So pray for me, brother, I need redemption
I'm just a man, a man on a mission
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
Pray for me, sister, give me a mention
I got no faith, and oh, did I mention
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble

Oh pack it up, and hit the road
And only take my lighter
I've seen the glitz, I've seen the glam
But I prefer the pay dirt

SELENE

To the top of all the world
To the tasteless underworld
To the center of your heart
Oh, Cleopatra is the only one you loved
To the demonstrated smile
To the lonely love child
Destination desolation
Tell me when you reach the brink of life
Just a picture on your wall
That's nice, what a metaphoric fall

Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh, what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through the tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

This is not what I expect
This is not what I expect
I can see it in your tears
And now they’re crowning me the Caesar

An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away (fire)

Off in the distance, there is resistance
Bubbling up and festering
Hey Mr. Motion, make me a potion
Shake it all up with your mystery
How come I've never seen your face around here?
I know every single face around here
A man on a mission, changing the vision
I was never welcome here

We don't have a choice to stay
We'd rather die than do it your way

This is the tunnel's light
Blood in the writing, stuck in the fighting
Look through the rifle's sight
How come I've never seen your face around here?

Hearing the heckle, holding the shackle
I was never welcome here

I WAS ME

It's just another day
It's just another year
"One step at a time", they say
"One trip, and you're back that way"
I don't recognize these eyes
I don't recognize these hands
Please believe me when I tell you
That this is not who I am

If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But the photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back when I, I was me

I'll try hard to make this ride
I'll try hard to win this fight

Give me strength to fight
Help me feel alive again
Make me whole inside
Instead, this hole inside is killing me
And I'm begging you

If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But the photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back when I, I was me

RELEASE

Twenty miles from anyone
Set my sights on the setting sun
Heaven talks, but not to me
Cause Heaven knows that nothing good comes free

Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?

I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down

Petty lies to everyone
In the hopes that I could be someone
Heaven talks, but not to me
And now I wonder if it's meant to be

Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down

I'll take your word, cause after all
You've never lied, oh not at all
But look at me, oh what a mess
I get caught up in the things that matter the least
Oh let me have release

I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down

SECOND CHANCES

Older than water, stubborn as stone
There'll be no forgiveness for all that you've known
Oh these days, oh these days get heavy
Hotter than friction, subtle as sound
There'll be no forgiveness for you to come around
Oh these days, oh these days get heavy


I get older and life fades
But you remain

Open up again, I believe in second chances
Please let me in, oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you, I will not let you down
Open up again, I believe in second chances

Quicker than lightning, whiter than bone
If you can erase it, then I can atone
Oh these days, oh these days get heavy

I get older and life fades
But you remain
Open up again, I believe in second chances
Please let me in, oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you, I will not let you down
Open up again, I believe in second chances

Forgive me
Forgive me

Open up again, I believe in second chances
Please let me in, oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you, I will not let you down
Open up again, I believe in second chances

Goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight

THIEF

If only you, you could see
The darkest place that you could be
Oh, maybe then, you'd understand
From desert heat to cobbled streets
From broken home to the city beat
There's so much more than you could know

So take me back when I believed
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief
And all the heights that I could reach
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief

If I could live a thousand times
If I could make a thousand tries
Oh, maybe then, I'd get it right
The more I see, the more I know
That everyone just wants a show
No, we don't want to see the truth

So take me back when I believed
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief
And all the heights that I could reach
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief

When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?

So take me back when I believed
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief
And all the heights that I could reach
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief

CHA-CHING(TILL WE GROW OLDER)

(Hey!) I don't sleep so well at night
Waiting up and shivering
Heater's gone and money's tight
In this little home that I'm living in

You've gotta live your life
While your blood is boiling
Those doors won't open
While you stand and watch them

Oh-oh oh-oh oh
What is with you?
Oh-oh oh-oh oh
I've never seen this side of you

Oh-oh oh-oh oh

You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
I never hear those sounds that sing to me
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling

I don't think it's quite the same
Just running out to feel the rain
Staring as the stars parade
Are they telling me it's gonna be okay?

You've gotta live your life
While your blood is boiling
Those doors won't open
While you stand and watch them

SKIPPING STONES

I wake up every morning with a new resolve
Two hands and one heart, let the world revolve
One eye to the ocean and one to the sky
One life of devotion and where am I?
One heart to love within my chest
One life to live

I keep skipping stones, hoping for a change
But things just stay the same
I keep walking roads, looking for a home
That I can call my own
Skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones

One chance to reach out and find a place for me
One chance to find love for all humanity
One eye to the mountain and one to the sands
One dime for the fountain and one for my hand
One heart to love within my chest
One heart to love

I keep skipping stones, hoping for a change
But things just stay the same
I keep walking roads, looking for a home
That I can call my own
Skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
Skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones

Love is not a product of reasonings and statistics. It just comes — none knows whence — and cannot explain itself
Love is a madness, if thwarted it develops fast
When you fish for love, bait with your heart, not your brain

I keep skipping stones, hoping for a change
But things just stay the same
I keep walking roads, looking for a home
That I can call my own
Skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
Skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones

MY FAULT

I took a walk on a Saturday night
Fog in the air just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air
Shaking hands run through my hair
My fears, where do I go from here?

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other

Walking down to the water's edge
Asking why I'm here instead of home
Now I stand alone
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to fill inside with peace
Like you were here with me

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other

Oh, it's on the warmest night
It's in the brightest light
It's when the world is moving
Oh, it's in the faintest cry
It's in the lover's eyes
Is when I need you most
And don't you know?

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other

THE RIVER

In the latest midnight hour
When the world has gone to sleep
You gotta get up
When doubts begin to rise
And the world is at your feet
You gotta get up

Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself

I'm not a selfless man
I'm not a man of wealth
If I had all the world
Probably give it to myself
But the trees begin to walk
And the ground begins to talk
But myself

Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself

Hold my place
Don't you give up on me
Hold on, hold on

Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up
Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up
Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
For anyone but myself
Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up
Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
I cleanse in the river for somebody else

THE UNKNOWN

Woman help me, you turn my head in circles
Mama blessed me with magnet eyes for purple
Oh so let me show you something good
Pastor, preacher, I wanna say I'm sorry
Nice to meet ya', I think my eyes are starry
Pledge allegiance to my only

Sooner or later it all comes around
Hopefully then I will see
After the people and places are gone
You will come back, you will come back to me
To me, to me
You will come back to me
To me, to me

Auntie Mara, I think you know my reasons
I was a product of everything in season
Oh so heavy, set me free again
Oh my papa, if all the world could know you
You could stop a thousand wars across the globe
Oh I miss ya', show them something good

Sooner or later it all comes around
Hopefully then I will see
After the people and places are gone
You will come back, you will come back to me
To me, to me
You will come back to me

TOKYO

Baby's got a lot of baggage
It don't seem to matter, it don't seem to matter
Bought a ticket to the mid-west, just for business
But dismissed it from the interest
It was a risk just for a mistress
Who was a hostess on the West Coast
Don't you see it in my eyes tonight?
Baby's got a lot of baggage

Where do I have to go
To find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo, turn out the lights and let it go
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Kimi tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, pay in the palms of the rock'n'roll

Get that dynamite
Chick-a-boom on the town tonight
I never seem to get it right
But you can show me so politely
Now don't you see it in my eyes tonight?
Get that dynamite

Everything is made with the same old labels

FALLEN

Run for cover
My sense of fear is running thin
Under cover
Just like a candle in the wind

Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brother, sister, the ending is coming

Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just gonna ride it out

Every morning
I'm staring shadows in the eye
Oh, good morning
Will you just wait until I die?

Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brother, sister, the ending is coming

Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen

Ohh, tell everybody we are fallen

Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen

Even when your fire runs out
Will you start it up again?
We are fallen

ALL FOR YOU

I get caught in the water, get torn in the wind
I could drown in the river, while the sun burns dim
I get tossed by the ocean, fall deep in the sand
I’m drowned out by the thunder, lost in the land

Is anyone listening?
Is anyone around to see?

That I’m doing it all for you
I’m doing it all for you
I’m ready to go
I’m ready to go
I’m doing it all for you
I’m doing it all for you
I’m ready to go

Your body, start shaking
Your mind is now ready to go

ALL EYES

Everything you say is just a lie and now I'm leaving
To the city where the people are awake to chase a dream that isn't real
And we're 'posed to be something that we're not
Just wanna change a lot and sign our name after the dot
Everything you see is just a century of anarchy
All my corresponding colors that symbolize the things we can attest
Arrange, we can assess, we can attain
We are the entry for entities to entice and entertain

All eyes, they're on you
Don't deny, you've got to
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me

Take my side
Take my side, don't look back
Now I'm easy and that's a fact

I'm free but I'm focused
I'm green but I'm wise
I'm hard but I'm friendly, baby
I'm sad but I'm laughing
I'm brave but I'm chicken shit

Well I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is playing a piano
And what it all comes down to my dear friends, yeah
Is that everything is just fine fine fine
Because I've got one hand in my pocket

Bourbon streets and bicycles
Holding you in carnivals

LOOK HOW FAR WE'VE COME

Take me on a whim
It's not the sun that provides us
It's not the moon that divides us
I can barely swim
And the current's coming in
And the current's coming in again

Stand up when you hear your name
Because I think that we're the same
We've got the same old hands
We've made the same old plans
Bail out to the yellow raft
It's got a hole, but we can last
We'll watch until it fades away

Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground
Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground

I've been painted gin
It's not the color I came in
It's not the shirt that I stain in
Hang me on a limb
And the current's coming in
And the current's coming in again

Stand up when you hear your name
'Cause I think that we're the same
We've got the same old hands
We've made the same old plans
Bail out to the yellow raft
It's got a hole but we can last
We'll watch until it fades away

Stop right there I've got a hole inside my chest
Until it fills up, I won't be satisfied
Stop right there I've got a hole inside my chest
Until it fills up, I won't be satisfied
Stop right there I've got a hole inside my chest
Until it fills up...

PANTOMIME

You've got me feeling like a pantomime
That's why I only love you part time

It's just a matter of "Oh, don't touch me
Don't you, don't you touch me no more"
He's got religious with the rhinestones
Takes care of business on his cellphone
It's just a matter of "Oh, don't touch me
Don't you dare touch me no more"

Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey, you think all your friends are funny

You've made it easy for the both of us
If he's got a chest and some arms
He'll hear me singing you
"Glory! Glory! Hallelujah"
You've made it easy for the both of us

COVER UP

There's lights that line these halls
That beckon us to stay
A glimmer in the distance
That gathers all the stray
And when I need it most
It breaks into a song
That runs through all my veins
And helps me to hold on

It was a long night
We ran along into the spotlight
You sang a song that made the children cry
And all the people knew my name
It was a bright light
These lands combine into a great big mass
We sang along to the very last
Oh, the jury stole my fame

And then we grabbed the sun
And it shined into these eyes
Believe me

Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight

Oh, you look so alive
D-d-d-did you think that we'd cry tonight?
Oh, did you think we'd cry?
Oh, can you feel my heart?
I think I feel it, too
D-d-d-did you think that we'd die tonight?
Oh, did you think we'd die?

And then we grabbed the sun
And it shined into these eyes
Believe me

Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight

Take my love, take it to the valley where the golden dove
Flies into the places where the silence screams
Fills it with the noises of our cluttered dreams, oh

Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight

I DON'T MIND

Did your mother like your Sunday dress?
Astrology eradicates
So what, so what?

It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

I'm not a lover let me be
For our hearts to bind or be set free
So what, so what?
I could show you, you could show me
I could show you, you could show me
I could show you, so much, so much

It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

Your blood, it flows in from the western sea
Your eyes, they shine in through these shaded trees
Oh, I believe in you
These places, they have changed
I don't know anything, but you know me
Oh, you know me

It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

Oh, not at all

I LOVE YOU ALL THE TIME

I'm never alone, I look at my phone
If I call you up, you're never at home
I love you all the time
I'm fueled up and high, a man among guys
A smile on my face, no reason to cry
I love you all the time

I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around, and sees another guy
I can tell you're gonna take your love away
I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around, and sees another guy
I would beg you if I thought it would make you stay

I can tell by that look in your eye

I can tell you're gonna take your love away

I would beg you if I thought it would make you stay

DESTINATION

I see the colors of the world are rearranging
The center sentinels are cunningly estranging, oh
I think a little about a lot and reach a verdict
You think a lot about a little never heard it
All of our energy
I bring these words to life

We stay up late and draw the lines
To every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination

I take me back to '91
I had the love life there, a loaded gun, alright
I see the colors of the world are rearranging
The center sentinels are leaving but I'm changing
All of our energy
I bring these words to life

We stay up late and draw the lines
To every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

30 LIVES

Good morning my love
It's been a while since we have talked
And you have grown
Your eyes are older than the tallest tree you see
Because thirty lives can be extraordinarily long

Lay me down, lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
Because I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright

Good morning myself
It's been a while since we have talked
And you have changed
For better or worse is yet to determine
But I am sure
That you'll keep living and breathing until this world turns over

Lay me down, lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
Because I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright
Lay me down, lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
Because I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright

CURSE

She barely knew your name

He was just a city, she's just a dirt road
But that never meant a thing
Running from the country
She needed out, but he held that diamond ring

'Cause I can't sit, oh, I can't talk
I got to leave this town and run to you
Curse these nights that speak your name
I got to leave this town and come to you
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
She barely knew your name

He was such a worry
No need to hurry
Those streets are slick at night
She would never listen
She left it all and headed towards the light
Oh your eyes look tired
But love was all she knew
Screaming out in agony
She gave her life for you

'Cause I can't sit, oh, I can't talk
I got to leave this town and run to you
Curse these nights that speak your name
I got to leave this town and come to you
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
She barely knew your name
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I can't sit, oh, I can't talk
I got to leave this town and run to you
Curse these nights that speak your name
I got to leave this town and come to you
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
She barely knew your name

LOST CAUSE

Oh, dig my shallow grave
'Cause it's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

Wait, all this time that I have spent away
Makes me think that I might be okay
The kiss of death will have to wait
My head is holding on to all those things you said
You taught me to be strong and get through it
The mist of darkness in my head

Oh, dig my shallow grave
'Cause it's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

Wait, no one said what's lost cannot be found
You are here to make it safe and sound
Oh, we can make it out alive
Fate, hath its way when all that's learned is sin
Nothing really matters in the end
As long as you are with me, friend

Oh, dig my shallow grave
'Cause it's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

No one can understand me
Like you can understand
No one can fill your shadow
'Cause you are all I am

Oh, dig my shallow grave
'Cause it's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

I NEED A MINUTE

Welcome to the land of hire
I hope you brought the right attire
The crippled man is waiting at the door
He said, "Your eyes are much too bright"
"The things you say are never right"
"The sins of all the world lie on your head"

So when you see me look the other way
'Cause oh, oh, lately all I do is play
All the glasses in the world say, "Come with me"

I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent, considering my middle name is Shake My Body
Take a sin, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my body

Welcome to the land of fail
I hope you brought your soul for sale
The greeter's still at home, I think he died
The land of smash and fairy tale
The truth of life is close to hell
The best you'll be is nearly dead or failed

So when you see me look the other way
'Cause oh, oh, lately all I do is say
"These plans I make believe all come with me"

I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent, considering my middle name is Shake My Body
Take a sin, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my body
I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent, considering my middle name is Shake My Body
Take a sin, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my body

Oh, perhaps it's all a dream and make believe
Oh, the last of all my dreams but still leave me

I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent, considering my middle name is Shake My Body
Take a sin, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my body
I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent, considering my middle name is Shake My Body
Take a sin, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my body

DRIVE

Get me right, all it takes is silent night
I want my eyes to see these lights
Hold, hold, hold on, hold, hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees, oh, forgive me
Get me right, look at these people flying kites
They seem to live forgotten nights
Hold, hold, hold on, hold, hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees, oh, forgive me

Drive, I got my head on aright
I got my people strapped tight
I got my head on aright, oh
I, I got my head on aright
I got my people strapped tight
I got my head on aright, oh

Oh, get me right, all it takes is starry nights
I want my eyes to see these lights
Hold, hold, hold on, hold, hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees, oh, forgive me
Get me right, look at these seagulls in the air
They seem to yell just like we care
Hold, hold, hold on, hold, hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees, oh, forgive me

Drive, I got my head on aright
I got my people strapped tight
I got my head on aright, oh

SO MANY VOICES

If I were you, I'd run away
Closin' your eyes and count to ten
Bird in the sky, peace in your mind
Closin' the door on yesterday
So many voices
So many voices

If I was me, weight on my back
Feelin' the sun upon my eyes
Where would I turn? What would I burn?
I am a pawn within your hands
So many voices
So many voices

Leavin' my youth, leavin' my truth
Carvin' in my blood into the stone
Lesser of two, either you lose
Or you come out and be alone
So many voices
There's so many choices
So many voices

What do I do? Where do I turn?
Even my screams cease to be heard
Lesser of two
Either you lose
Or you are bound to be alone
So many choices
There's so many noises
So many voices

DARKNESS

I can never leave you when you're lying in the bed
Face to the wall
Eyes locked on the floor
What did you mean by that, what did you mean by that?
Take it as a self invitation
Take it as your own means of salvation
If I could take it all
If I could take it all back

Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
And if it's too late for deciding
Oh, just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness

I could never beat it when you needed me the most
The more I try the less you try to come
How could I live like that, how could I live like that?
Take it as a self indication
Take it as your own means of vindication
If I could take it all
If I could take it all back

Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
And if it's too late for deciding
Oh, just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness

Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
It's too late for deciding
So just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness

Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
Oh, it is too late for deciding
So just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness

Living in the darkness
Please
Living, living in the darkness

LEAVE ME

Take a look inside
I've got nothing to hide, oh, no
I'll beat around the bush
I've got nothing but time, oh, no, oh, no

You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing's all I've got

Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run

So this is what it feels like
I'll give you the last word
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Now if this is the town, oh this is the place
If you are the one to give disgrace a name
Then so be it

You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing's all I've got

Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run
Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run

Oh take my car, oh take my house
I never liked that beat-up motor mouth
And, oh, it looks so warm tonight
Just like a stranger in the candlelight

Take, take, take, take, take, take it all

Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run
Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run

Leave me now
Leave me now

SPEAK TO ME

Draw a rumor; flashing lights and let all whispers die
Sixteen colors, I'm so lonely
Let, let the picture dry

'Cause everybody sees things differently
And everybody says things rationally
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go

Suppressed emotions flying past
Are heading out the other end
The precious love, the daily grind
It's wonderful
Elastic wasted, rubber ghost
Are floating past the midnight hour
They push aside the things that matter most
Wonderful

Trace the faces, X the places where the judges lie
I'm not scared of all the nothings
Let, let the whispers die
[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Aurora Florence]
'Cause everybody sees things differently
(Exciting news at discount price)
And everybody says things rationally
(A million opportunities)
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go...

I-M-A-G-I-N-E, oh
M-O-V-E-M-E-N-T, oh
I-M-A-G-I-N-E, oh
L-E-T-U-S-B-E-F-E-A-R-L-E-S-S

'Cause everybody sees things differently

And everybody says things rationally

So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go

THE PIT

I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes

Sitting here all by ourselves, counting all the people
As they pass us by
They gather all around and stare on down into a dark, dark pit
Don't go, please don't go
But they step on in, oh, they fall all in, they walk all over you
'Cause one step at a time, they all walk in a line
Down a false, false hope

I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes
I would rather stay here
Where the moon, it glows
Soaring doves and falling crows
Laughter is the only sound we'd hear

If I had one wish
I'd fill up that pit, I'd fill up that pit, oh
I'd cry 'til it filled to the brim
You'd swim to the top
And I'd grab your hand

Oh, how can I, how can I convince you to stay?
Where all the flowers bloom, the grass, it sways
And the rain, it pours, and the waves all roar
And the trees they grow
And the fallen crow soars down into that dark cold pit
And you follow it in
Oh, you follow it in

Well, I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes
I would rather stay here
Where the moon, it glows
Soaring doves and falling crows
Laughter is the only sound we'd hear

If I had one wish
I'd fill up that pit, well, I'd fill up that pit, oh
I'd cry 'til it filled to the brim
You'd swim to the top
And I'd grab your hand

CLOUDS

Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!
Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!

Looking to the lonely telegraph that crept into your room
Listen to the bleeding voices of the ones around her tomb

The radio is playing, but I can't hear them sing
The people all explaining, but they don't know a thing

Give me a sign, give me a sign
I wanna die tonight

They say that London sounds like a city of red
All the prisoners wait for a turn to be dead
Oh, you don't love me
You don't love me like you say you do

I can take a picture, you can be a picture
Stitched into the fading black
I can take you home, now you can be a home
And we'll never look on back

The radio is playing, but I can't hear them sing
The people all explaining, but they don't know a thing

Give me a sign, give me a sign

All the prisoners wait for a turn to be dead
Oh, You don't love me
You don't love me like you say you do
Oh, London sounds like a city of red
All the prisoners wait for a turn to be dead
And I don't want to die
No, I don't want to die
Tonight

Come out, I'm waiting on your front porch
You came in from the back door
And we drift along the flooded sea of muddy waters
Clouds above us crying tears of sins all dying
We're begging for a reason
Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!
Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!

Now, come out, I'm waiting on your front porch
You came in from the back door
We drift along a flooded sea of muddy waters
Clouds above us crying tears of sins all dying
We're begging for a reason
This year seems like a season
Belief in how we're living
Story with no ending
The storm is beating down
But we're sinking to the sky
We're sinking to the sky
We're sinking to the sky
We're sinking to the sky

PISTOL WHIP

I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly what you mean

Oh, my dear it's a pistol whip to my
Broken head, and the stars are spinning
So I pick one up and put it on my shoulder
Look, look, look
You're a world class case, I'll punch my stomach
All the people see me rolling over
With my hand on my shoulder, oh, with the star like I told ya
Pace, pace, pace

Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss of being a killer
Star's on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo

I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly what you mean

Shadows soar, and breathing heavy
I fall four flights up, halfway steady
With my hand on my shoulder, oh, with the star like I told ya
Look, look, look
I'mma take ten steps and close my eyes
Turn around and draw to my surprise
I clutch my heart and scream, "Yeehoo!"
Pace, pace, pace

Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss of being a killer
Star's on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo

I don't want to hear the words leave your lips
Love's lyrics leave you missing life
Tell yourself a lie and look through the crosshair
Tie that blindfold tight
I don't want to leave the puzzle, I'm done I got a
A lot of rope to burn, lot to learn, whoa
I don't want to leave the puzzle, I'm done I got a
A lot of rope to burn, lot to learn, whoa
I don't want to hear you say you believe when you don't

Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss of being a killer
Star's on my shoulder, holding you over

Always be careful, don't ever feel good

What you see is what you get
Stop trying to be somebody else

Where Daddy works and Momma sews
Just wanna live my life, don't wanna hear one thing
Oh, I plug my ears and live the dream (yeah)

Wait, explain, you're zippin' off
Don't let it off so easy

Oh I don't want to see your face in this broken town
(I don't want to see your face in this broken town)
I'm runnin' down South to bury my head in the ground
(Runnin' down South, bury my head in the ground)
Oh, I don't need money and I don't need you
But if you come around I gotta think of you home

Boots, oh walk me home
Where Daddy works and Momma sews
Just wanna live my life (Wanna live my life)
Don't wanna hear one thing
Oh, I plug my ears and live the dream

UPTIGHT

Say goodbye to all your friends
They will miss you when this trends
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
I get so uptight, I get so uptight

Sit tight, green light, everybody's out at night, go
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
Those things they believe in, they get hazy
I think I mean it

When the current drags me in (when the current drags me in)
Leave me to the hands of men (leave me to the hands of men)
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
I get so uptight, I get so uptight

Sit tight, green light, everybody's out at night, go
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
Those things they believe in, they get hazy
I think I mean it
Sit tight, green light, everybody's out at night, go
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
Those things they believe in, they get hazy
I think I mean it

DOPLHINS

There's dolphins over my head
Swimmin' through my conscience
My working days are over
Heading out to make my way
When darkness is around us
We'll dive into the cavern
Our working days are over
Heading out to make my way

It's time for us to go to sleep
These bonds will never let us meet
This open air is choking me to death
I fill my lungs with you

My faith is at adolescent
I've learned myself a lesson
If I hold myself higher
I think it'd get much higher

It's time for us to go to sleep
These bonds will never let us be
This open air is choking me to death
I fill my lungs with you

I fill my lungs with you, ooh-ooh
I fill my lungs with you, ooh-ooh-oh
I fill my lungs with you

It's time for us to go to sleep
These bonds will never let us meet
This open air is choking me to death
I fill my lungs—
It's time for us to go to sleep
These bonds will never let us meet

This open air is choking me to death
I fill my lungs with you
With you, you, you

LIVING MUSICAL

It all begins with a look in the eyes
That goes beyond the body into
Feelings you tried to forget all about, a sudden attraction
Between two with a few of the mind that distracts
Of the stars, that it builds, but it flies to the bottom
Baby I'm blessed to be here
Blessed to just bask in your presence, ooh

And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak
My eyes to yours
We connect for a moment
It seems to be a lifetime

I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you, ooh
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you

Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For a pretty girl with confidence, oh
Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa

She was coughing on the coolers as she asked for my number
I was living in a dream, feelings roll down like thunder
I never met my match, melodic melodies mumble
A cocky young thing meets a girl and I stumble
For the first time in my life I don't know where to start
With a brush in my hand I don't know when it's art
When I laugh she must smile, when I smile she must laugh
Is it possible that I'd go for a girl in my path?

And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak
My eyes to yours
We connect for a moment
It seems to be a lifetime

I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you, ooh
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you

Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For a pretty girl with confidence, whoa
Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa

Oh, be easy on me baby; I'm a sensitive mess
You're a beautiful girl, nothing else, nothing less
Just tell me what you're feeling what I know to be true
And I'll give all that I have, baby, I'll give it all to you

Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For pretty girl with confidence
Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa

FOREVER YOUNG

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever

Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Music's for the sad men

Forever young, I want to be forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young

CURTAIN CALL

It's a, a strange thing
Just a miracle dream
To be at peace with a fling
What if I'm more than crushes?
And moved past more than just lust
To feel it deep inside
Crying out to my trust
It's indescribably pushin' it
My mind is uncertainty
Beside I want a love that's all certain
Beyond a doubt I want to shout it out
I will shout it out to the world
To find a woman with certainty

STARS

Lost at sea, so unexplored, tomorrow the world goes dark
Bring you home, tell me why
She lives to hear me talk about
Where the dreams, they cry
And hit, oh, high my face for more
The [?] move just wanna know
She's all I want so [?]

Too late, I was waiting on a broken day
I wish the world would sit and wait
For you, for you
For you, for you

Set me free from all the fields of all the squinted eyes
Tell me why the sun, it died
Tell me all the lies you hear
About a time when I was young
And all I hear was trying to find

Too late, I was waiting on a broken day
I wish the world would sit and wait
For you, for you
For you, for you

Kiss me when the sun is gone
Hold me in your arms
Tell me why this darkness is a lie upon the stars

Too late, I was waiting on a broken day
I wish the world would sit and wait
For you, for you
For you, for you

FEBRUARY

I close my eyes so tight I might not realize you're gone
I tell a million stories like I'm old and she's young
It's cold out here at night but I don't mind
I feel the heat creeping up my spine, but it's alright
It's alright

I close my eyes, shut 'em up so tight
You ask me why I never sleep at night
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
I play my cards, never play 'em right
I tell the same old stories, tell 'em over twice
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh

February seems to be the worst of all my friends
She brings in all the darkness when the year, it just begins
But, oh, it seems so calm at the strangest of times
Loneliness, it seems to be the worst of all her crimes
And I'm alright
It's alright

I close my eyes, shut 'em up so tight
You ask me why I never sleep at night
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
I play my cards, never play 'em right
I tell the same old stories, tell 'em over twice
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh

Don't you let me go
I'm holdin' on
I will let you know
What's going on
You're the reason why I sing this song
Oh

I close my eyes, shut 'em up so tight
You ask me why I never sleep at night
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
I play my cards, never play 'em right
I tell the same old stories, tell 'em over twice
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright

OFF TO WAR

Don't cry mother dear, your boy has left you for a couple years
He's packed his bags, packed in his courage
Put away his fears and stepped into the unknown
And postponed all complications, yeah
A kiss goodbye and an upset stomach sends me on my way
What I believe, it gets me by, it gets me through the days
Tears fall and puddles form and days without an end
Determination never building, the war has just begun

And it's 1, 2, 3, 4, boys are marching out to war
4, 3, 2, 1, they won't stop 'til it's all done
And it's a left, right, steadfast
Fast to the field with their destiny sealed
Right, left, two-step, off to the plane and the men come home

Oh, oh, don't you cry for me
Oh, oh, I'm coming home to your arms

1, 2, 3, 4, take the lead and I'll follow you
You're the man with the plan, I'm the pawn in your hand
Piece to be played, sacrifice to be made
It's my fate in your hands
With my brothers by my side, form a line, shoulders tight
I will push the right, oh will you push the left-right?
If one man falls, they don't move till he's up
A one-man unit at the wrist, our handcuff
It's handcuff

And it's 1, 2, 3, 4, boys are marching out to war
4, 3, 2, 1, they won't stop 'til it's all done
And it's a left, right, steadfast
Fast to the field with their destiny sealed
Right, left, two-step, off to the plane and the men come home

Oh, oh, don't you cry for me
Oh, oh, I'm coming home to your arms
Oh, oh, don't you cry for me
Oh, oh, I'm coming home to your arms

And it's 1, 2, 3, 4, boys are marching out to war
4, 3, 2, 1, they won't stop 'til it's all done
And it's a left, right, steadfast
Fast to the field with their destiny sealed
Right, left, two-step, off to the plane and the men go home

VOLUME DROPS

I am aching, near breaking
I'm just taking my time to stand in line
For a dance with you, whoa, dance with you, whoa oh
It may not appear, but it's been fully clear
That I'm standing here, fully pleading, near bleeding
Dying, for a chance with you, oh, whoa

Passion tops, time stops, volume drops
You put your face to mine
If I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I can stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you

If you stand with my heart in hand
Oh, perfect and, perfect and, perfect and
So unaware of my longing stare
If all I care is to dance with you

Passion tops, time stops, volume drops
You put your face to mine
I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I could stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you

I freeze, I feel debris, my hands been seized
My thoughts are cut, I close my eyes shut
Knowing it's not you, but there's a chance it's you
For a dance with me, oh, whoa, yeah, whoa-oh-oh

Passion tops, time stops, volume drops
You put your face to mine
I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I can stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you

BOTTLE OF COKE

Always take it slow, I'm just a little too bold
I'm growing older than my age
I can't believe, I can't believe that
You've been on my mind
Oh, call it like you see it, I'm a little too early
Let it be, I'm just a puddle of mud
Staining everything I see
That walks all over me

I give it up
You're just a bottle of Coke
I'm just a little too broke to believe it
Count me in
I'm just the grayest drown
And you're the talk of the town, can you believe it?

Wise men say I'm foolish, I just give 'em all a grin
The wise are prudent, never walking on a limb
I live on stars that burn so bright they close their eyes
Typically I'm weak when I'm a little bit nervous
Oh, you think I'm such a competent fool
I'm telling everyone I know I'm strolling streets

I give it up
You're just a bottle of Coke
I'm just a little too broke to believe it
Count me in
I'm just the grayest drown
And you're the talk of the town, can you believe it?

I just keep on hoping you think
What you think when you thought
That I was gold, and I'm not
But I give you what I got
I'm just a little bit old
When I need to be young
I'm just a little bit young
When I need to be

I give it up
You're just a bottle of Coke
I'm just a little too broke to believe it
Count me in
I'm just the grayest drown
And you're the talk of the town, can you believe
I give it up
You're just a bottle of Coke
I'm just a little too broke to believe it
Count me in
I'm just the grayest drown
And you're the talk of the town, can you believe it?

I just keep on hoping you think
What you think when you thought
That I was gold, and I'm not
But I give you what I got
I'm just a little bit old
When I need to be young
I'm just a little bit young
When I need to be
I just keep on hoping you think
What you think when you thought
That I was gold, and I'm not
But I give you what I got
I'm just a little bit old
When I need to be young
I'm just a little bit young

I WISH YOU WELL

I love you, you
Running back oh, back to, back to you, you, you, you
I see your anger and hate and I hear ya say, say, say
Let me hear you out at night
And after that I hope you're bulletproof
Then that's okay

Oh, I wanna see you smile again
After all, I think we've fallen to the bottom
Oh, I wish you well

Tomorrow, oh, today here comes the rain
I don't want to, I don't wanna explode, I don't want to explode
When I see your anger awaits
I will never say I
Say, say, say but I, but I thought I'm bulletproof
And that's okay

Oh, I wanna see you smile again
After all, I think we've fallen to the bottom
Oh, I wish you well

I wish you well

UNSEEN

Broken homes, fighting brothers
Drugs sold upon the streets
Terrorism and alcoholism
These selfish motives guide the world
Weeping mothers, whoa, crying fathers

Let's live until we die

Grew up for business
I'll do whatever it takes
Don't work a day unless you're paid
One night stands and broken hearts
We forgot how to love
I'll shoot 'em up and take 'em down
Oh, don't bleed on my ground

They are so broken but, oh, we hear them singing, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

STARLIGHT

Do you realize it's almost come?
Do you realize it's almost come?
Walkin' for a while until its done
Beatin' on my back and tell it to run
I'm gonna make it into much
I'm gonna breathe until I burst open, open

Lay me down
Lay me down

The old and the young
Save me from myself
Starlight
'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong

Save me from myself

'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
Could this be over for too long
Save me from myself

Covered moonless night
Light my night, starlight
Light the sky
Light our sky, oh
Again, my friends

'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
Could this be over for too long
Save me from myself
Starlight
'Cause when this world is beating down on me
I'll search for light to set me free
Oh, save me, starlight
And when this love is all you used to know
I'll search for light to let you go
Oh, save me, starlight

TAKE TAKE TAKE

You give me love
But then you take it away
And I'm left to search where to hide
You give me love (Love), love (Love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times

I think I'm cursed
I think I'm dying for days
As I build to the top with you
You give me love (Love), love (Love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times, oh

Take, take, take
But don't give it back now
Wait, wait, wait
I've loaded up a gun
Bang, bang, bang
I bang on your back door
Hang, hang, hang
Me up on your wall

You give me headaches
Oh, all I need is a break
From your clever little lies
You give me love (Love), love (Love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times

I think I'm cursed
I think I'm dying for days
As I build to the top with you
You give me love (Love), love (Love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times, oh

Take, take, take

Wait, wait, wait

I bang on your back door
Hang, hang, hang

Ah, ah, ah
It's 2 AM in the city of sin, it's 2 AM in the city of sin
It's 2 AM in the city of sin, it's 2 AM in the city of sin
It's 2 AM in the city of sin, it's 2 AM in the city of sin

Take, take, take
But don't give it back now
Wait, wait, wait

TO FALL DOWN

Got dressed in the morning light
Gotta leave this place far behind
Breathe or die
You say I don't wanna go back
I don't wanna go back
Take me home tonight
Breathe or die

We could run so far
To fall down, to fall down
And we could try so hard
To fall down, to fall down

Make my way where the sirens sleep
You can take my life but spare my soul
Breathe or die
They say you don't really care, you don't really care
Give me a reason to die
Breathe or die

We could run so far
To fall down, to fall down
And could we try so hard
To fall down, to fall down

Try to speak my mind to you
Try to tell you what to do
And the end, it's still so lonely
Open up, your blood is bleeding blue
And the seasons bleed right through you
You know, you know I'm here for you
I'm here for you
I'm here for you

We could run so far
To fall down, to fall down
And we could try so hard
To fall down, to fall down

HOLE INSIDE OUR CHESTS

Look at the moon
It looks gold
I think it put me in a chokehold, ooh
Alleviate my deep pride
I think it stabbed me in my strong side, ooh
Just when I thought I got it all
You take it all, you take it all, you take it all, ooh

Just give me love
Too much to ask?
I want the one with the night on a flask, ooh
I think my heart, it's full of ooze
My brain is sparking like a burnt out fuse, ooh

I think my heart belongs to the sea
Let it sink to the deep

We are just a few with a hole inside our chests
Oh, drown oh, plug me up
Dancing to the drums of the beats inside their hearts
Oh, drown oh, plug me up

We march in sync
My head in yours
The beat is cleaning out my dirty pores, ooh
You think I'm kidding, I think I'm thinking
I think we should we all take a break from lovely singing, ooh

And there's my brain
It's on the floor
It's giving lovers all a brain tour, ooh
And there it is, oh pity me!
Forget this all and let's march out to the sea, ooh

I think my heart belongs to the sea
Let it sink to the deep

We are just a few with a hole inside our chests
Oh, drown oh, plug me up
Dancing to the drums of the beats inside their hearts
Oh, drown oh, plug me up

We are just a few with a hole inside our chests
Oh, drown oh, plug me up
Dancing to the drums of the beats inside their hearts
Oh, drown oh, plug me up

EASY


Easy now
You don’t have nothing left to prove
Easy now
Oh, it’s laid out for you

Who made you think you weren't good enough?
Who made, who made, who made, who made you think that you weren’t good enough?
Who made you think that you weren't good enough?
Who made, who made, who made, who made you think that you weren’t good enough?

Easy now
You don’t have nothing left to prove
Easy now
Oh, it’s laid out for you

But am I strong enough?
Oh, am I whole enough?
And do I have enough
To give?
But am I strong enough?
Oh am I whole enough?
And do I have enough
To give?
[Chorus]
Easy now
You don’t have nothing left to prove
Easy now
Oh it’s laid out for you

But am I strong enough?
Oh, am I whole enough?
And do I have enough
To give?
But am I strong enough?
Oh am I whole enough?
And do I have enough
To give?

Who made you think you weren't good enough?
Who made, who made, who made, who made you think that you weren’t good enough?
Who made you think that you weren't good enough? (Easy now)
Who made, who made, who made, who made you think that you weren’t good enough? (You don’t have nothing left to prove)
But am I strong enough? (Easy now)
Oh, am I whole enough?
And do I have enough (You don’t have nothing left to prove)
To give?

DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY

She could always hear every word they say
Everybody walks like they just know the way
Every single day holding back the tears
She'd never say a word 'cause there's nobody that hears

I don't want this body, I don't want this voice
I don't wanna be here, but I guess I have no choice
Just let me live my truth, that's all I wanna do
Baby, you're not broken, just a little bit confused

It's okay to be not okay
It's just fine to be out of your mind
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind, mind

Minе is broken, how is yours?
Sure, it helps to hеar the news and political discourse
Fear, that is what he felt
Every single day..
